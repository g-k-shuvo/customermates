# Overlay contract

Customermates composes its overlays from the shadcn `new-york-v4` primitives in this directory. The wrappers add the repository's mobile viewport, safe-area, collision, scrolling, dismissal, and focus-return contract. Mechanically decidable rules are enforced by [the convention suite](../../tests/conventions/overlay-contract.test.ts); runtime behavior is exercised in the [overlay gallery](<../../app/[locale]/(protected)/test/overlays/page.tsx>).

## Decision matrix

Choose an overlay by what the interaction is, not by how much room is left.

| Use               | When                                                                         | Width                                      | Max height               | Scroll owner       | Small screens                                    |

## Required composition

- Give each overlay exactly one vertical scroll owner, with `min-h-0` on every ancestor between that owner and the positioned root.
- Align every visible overlay header left across Dialog, Drawer, Sheet, Popover, AlertDialog, and AppModal presentations. Non-overlay card compositions may opt into another alignment explicitly.
- Keep AppModal headers limited to titles and non-interactive metadata. Pass zero to two typed action descriptors through the AppModal `actions` slot. AppModal alone renders their 36×36 controls, 16px icons, semantic color, accessible name, tooltip, disabled/busy behavior, and fixed top-right row beside Close; callers cannot override those visual dimensions.
- Keep task-overlay headers and action footers divider-free. Use separators inside structured content only; retain each primitive's outer surface or edge border.
- Keep ordinary anchored overlays at `z-50`. Persistent assistant panels use `OVERLAY_RAISED_PANEL_LAYER_CLASS`, and overlays or guidance launched from those panels use `OVERLAY_TOPMOST_LAYER_CLASS`, so page filters cannot cover the assistant without hiding its own controls.
- Controlled overlays without a primitive trigger use `useOverlayFocusReturn`. Custom navigation lifecycles reuse `overlay-focus-target` rather than duplicating element, stable-ID, visibility, or remount logic.
- Always provide a stable focus fallback when an opener can unmount. Never return focus into an inert or closing overlay.
- Import raw `radix-ui` overlay roots and `cmdk` only inside `components/ui/*`; all other code composes these wrappers.

Preferred patterns:

- Derive block size from `--overlay-block-budget` or `--sheet-block-budget` in [`styles/globals.css`](../../styles/globals.css).
- Read safe areas through `var(--safe-top|right|bottom|left)` and add them to existing padding, for example `calc(1rem + var(--safe-left))`.
- Anchor floating content with Popover or Floating UI. Use `PopoverAnchor` with a virtual reference when no DOM trigger exists, as in [`editor-floating-menu.tsx`](../editor/editor-floating-menu.tsx).
- Cap anchored content with the matching Radix available-width and available-height variables.
- When a Sheet hosts an AppCard, constrain `SheetBody` as a non-scrolling flex column and delegate scrolling to `AppCardBody`; do not leave both regions scrollable.

Prohibited patterns:

- Block-axis `vh`, `h-screen`, or new hard-coded viewport arithmetic.
- Raw `env(safe-area-inset-*)` outside the shared tokens.
- Hand-positioned `fixed` or `absolute` floating surfaces with a `z-` class.
- A second `max-h` scroller nested inside a modal.
- `border-t` or `border-b` dividers on task-overlay headers and action footers.

## Reviewed limits

Nested dropdown submenus cannot always fit beside their parent on a small screen. The shared cap handles negative available-width reports, but prefer a flat menu or the responsive Dialog/Drawer path for phone-critical actions. There are currently no `DropdownMenuSubContent` production call sites.

`SelectContent` deliberately defaults to `position="popper"` rather than shadcn's `item-aligned`. Item-aligned does not provide inline-axis collision avoidance or `--radix-select-content-available-width`; Popper keeps the surface inside the viewport gutter. The shared width cap still protects a call site that opts back into item-aligned.

The `/test/overlays` gallery covers long and overflowing content, German copy, long identifiers, nested states, validation, and many-action layouts. Cases are deep-linkable with `?case=&content=&actions=&anchor=&state=&safe=`.
