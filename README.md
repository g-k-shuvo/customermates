Customermates is a CRM for modern teams that want a clear system for contacts, organizations, deals, services, and tasks without the usual enterprise-heavy setup. It combines practical CRM workflows with API access, webhooks, n8n automation, MCP-based tooling, and AI-agent workflows.

You can use the managed cloud version or run Customermates yourself in your own infrastructure with Docker Compose.

## 🚀 Getting Started

There are two ways to start using Customermates:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[Cloud](https://customermates.com)** | Fastest way to get started. Managed by Customermates. |
| **[Self-Hosting](https://customermates.com/docs/self-hosting)** | Run Customermates on your own server with Docker Compose and PostgreSQL. |

## 🐳 Self-Hosting

Self-hosting is two files (`docker-compose.yml` and `.env`) plus `docker compose up -d`. No `git clone`, no build step. The published image at `ghcr.io/customermates/customermates:latest` runs migrations on first boot.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose v2.
- A domain name if you want TLS (optional for local).
- ~2 GB RAM and a couple of GB of disk per thousand records.

### Setup

```bash
mkdir customermates && cd customermates
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/customermates/customermates/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/customermates/customermates/main/.env.selfhost.template -o .env
# edit .env with real values
docker compose up -d
```

Required `.env` values:

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: long random string (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: change the default.
- `BASE_URL`: your public URL (e.g. `https://crm.example.com`).
- `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_OPERATOR_EMAIL`: for signup verification, password reset, and invitation emails.

First boot takes ~1 minute while Prisma applies migrations. Watch with `docker compose logs -f app`, then open `http://localhost:4000` (or your `APP_PORT`).

### Day-to-day

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d   # update
docker compose restart                         # restart after .env changes
docker compose logs -f app                     # logs
```

Front the app with a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, Traefik) for TLS. Customermates sets secure cookies when `BASE_URL` uses `https://` — make sure the proxy forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto`.

## 🛠️ Development

Create an isolated worktree and run Customermates locally:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git worktree add ../customermates-my-change -b feat/my-change origin/main
cd ../customermates-my-change
nvm use
yarn db:provision
cp .env.cloud.template .env
# Paste the printed DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL into .env.
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn db:reset
yarn dev
```

`yarn db:provision` creates a PostgreSQL 17 container and named volume owned by the current worktree. Re-running it is idempotent. `yarn db:reset` applies the migrations, seeds the database, and prepares the workflow schemas. Replacing the database volume is destructive and only happens with `yarn db:provision --recreate`; use `yarn db:provision --destroy` to remove the worktree's owned database when the worktree is retired.

Useful scripts:

- `yarn dev`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn lint`
- `yarn openapi:generate`
- `yarn db:provision`
- `yarn db:reset`

### Build machine requirements

The production build static-generates every route and needs headroom to do it. Build on a
machine with at least **4 vCPU and 16 GB of RAM**; below that the build is killed part way
through with a heap out-of-memory error. The Docker build already sets
`NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=5120"` in its builder stage for the same reason, so
building the image on a smaller machine fails even though `yarn dev` runs happily there.

## 📄 License

Customermates uses an open-core licensing model.

The Community Edition—all first-party code outside `ee/`, including `features/audit-log/`—is licensed under [AGPL-3.0-only](./LICENSE). Audit logging is therefore free for production self-hosting.

Other first-party files in `ee/` are source-available under the [Customermates Commercial License](./ee/LICENSE.md), subject to its AGPL client-material exception. Production use of Commercial Software outside the limited Community Build permission, including any Enterprise Feature, requires a Commercial Agreement.

The official Community image at `ghcr.io/customermates/customermates` is built from the shared codebase and contains compiled Commercial Software. The limited Community Build permission allows anyone to run its unmodified commercial support components where documented `APP_MODE=self-hosted` operation necessarily executes them for entitlement bookkeeping, feature denial, and audit-only shared activity timelines; it does not license Enterprise Feature use.
