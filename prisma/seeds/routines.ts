Read `total` and the `sums` block: sums covers every matching deal, not just this page, so never add the items up yourself.\n3. Repeat step 2 once per remaining Status option (Won, Lost, Abandoned) to get each one\'s count and totalValue. Report every option you found, so the counts add up to the whole deal list.\n4. list_records for deals again with filters [ Status equals Open, { field: "contactIds", operator: "hasNone" } ].

Say which weight you applied to Open (read it from the schema, do not assume) and that Won counts at its own weight.\n- One line per open deal, ranked by weighted value: name, organization, total value, weighted value, Project Period.\n- Timing: for each open deal whose Project Period end date is before today, say how many days it is overdue, worst first.

Every response carries a total, so keep paging until you have covered it. list_records returns only id and name, so read values with get_records, passing all ids of one entity in a single batched call with include masterData, not one call per record.\n3. Duplicate candidates. Group contacts that share a last name, or share a first name and the same linked organization, or share an email domain with a near-identical name. Before calling anything a duplicate, compare the candidates' email identifiers, their Phones values and their linked organization. Two people at the same account are not a duplicate, and the same surname at two different accounts is usually two different people. This workspace contains collisions that need exactly that judgement: Tim Wagner and Tim Weber, Lea Bauer and Mara Bauer, and Laura Fischer, Lukas Fischer and Paul Fischer. Concluding that none of them is a duplicate is a correct result: report it as 'no duplicates found' and list the pairs you cleared. Never promote a name similarity to a duplicate just to have something to report. For organizations look for a spelling or legal-form variant of an account that already exists, for example a second record for McKinsey & Company, Deutsche Post or NRW.BANK.\n4. Missing enrichment. Use list_records filters with the noValue operators (isNull, hasUnset) against the column ids from step 1: contacts with no Phones value and contacts with no Sales Pipeline value, organizations with no Website and organizations with no Type. Also list contacts with no linked organization. If a filter is rejected, fall back to the values you already read in step 2. Where a section has no rows, write 'none' under it and move on.\n5. Orphaned records. List organizations with no linked contact, no linked deal and no linked task; a link to a workspace user does not count.\n6. Write exactly one thing this run: a single task via create_tasks named 'Data quality review, week of <ISO date>', with userIds set to the current user id from step 1, and the full findings in its notes as markdown under the headings 'Likely duplicates', 'Cleared collisions', 'Missing fields' and 'Orphaned records'.

Say which tier each candidate reached.\n\nNever call delete_records, never merge or edit a contact or organization, never edit or delete a custom column, and never call send_email or send_chat_message.

Duplicate check first, before any enrichment. Call search_records with entities ["contact"], limitPerEntity 25 and searchTerm the contact\'s last name, then again with the local part of its mail identifier. search_records returns only id and name, so call get_records on each candidate that is not the trigger contact before judging. Treat a candidate as a duplicate when it has the same full name and the same linked organization, or the same Phones value in E.164 form (a leading + and digits only). Saving a contact reassigns an email identifier to its newest owner, so an exact email collision appears as the older contact having lost that address rather than two contacts sharing it; a stripped identifier is itself duplicate evidence. On a duplicate: call update_record_notes with entity contact, mode append, on the new contact, notes "Possible duplicate of <name> (<id>), review before use"; call create_tasks with one task named "Review possible duplicate contact: <name>", contactIds holding both contact ids, and the evidence in notes; then stop.

If every external participant is linked, stop immediately: write nothing, call no other tool, and make your run summary "all participants linked". That is the common case and it must stay cheap.\n3. Otherwise, for each unlinked participant take displayName and identifier (a phone number, an email address, or a provider handle) and call search_records with searchTerm set to the display name and entities ["contact","organization"]. If the identifier is an email, search again on its domain (bmw.example resolves to the BMW organization). Then read who else is in the thread: an unlinked person talking with sophie.wagner@bmw.example or leon.becker@bmw.example is almost certainly on the BMW account.

Open each of those threads with get_messaging_threads and its threadId; page 1 holds the newest messages. Read the newest message's direction: outbound means we already replied, so leave that thread completely alone. Only a thread whose newest message is inbound counts as unanswered.\n3. Identify the sender of each unanswered thread. The thread's participant entry already carries contact { id, name } when that person is linked to the CRM, so use it directly.

Never call action delete. If an activity widget is missing, report it rather than recreating it.\n\n5. Finish with one call to create_tasks: name "Workspace health <YYYY-MM-DD>", userIds the id of Max Bergmann from list_users, and notes a short markdown summary with one line per check: webhook enabled flag and delivery tally by status code, connected accounts not "ok", role gaps found or filled, charts recreated, and every decision left for a human. Name the webhook and widgets explicitly so the admin can act without opening anything else.\n\n6. Never call update_workspace_settings: currency and terminology belong to the owner. Never call send_email, send_chat_message or delete_records, and never create, update or delete any contact, organization, deal or service.',
